# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

![Flappy Bird AI Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

This project combines the classic Flappy Bird game implemented in Pygame with an AI player trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The AI learns to play the game by evolving neural networks through genetic algorithms.

## Features

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay.
- NEAT algorithm for AI training.
- Dynamic obstacle generation.
- Real-time visualization of AI gameplay.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-neat.git
